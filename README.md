<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![product-screenshot]

> This project was a milestone in my journey to study the Introduction 
to Cybersecurity Nanodegree provided by Udacity.

You have been hired to secure the PC used at your friend’s business: Joe's 
Auto Body. Joe provides car repair services throughout the area. His previous 
employees used it for activities unrelated to work (e.g., web browsing, 
personal email, social media, games, etc.) and he now uses it to store his 
critical business information. He suspects that others may have broken into 
it and could be using it to transfer files across the internet. He has asked 
that you secure it for him according to industry best practices, so it can be 
once again used as a standard PC.

In this project, you are given a “broken” Windows 10 PC and asked to figure 
out what’s wrong with it and then make changes to fix and secure it. The 
process of analyzing and applying security happens in workplaces around the 
globe and is exactly what cybersecurity professionals do daily. This project 
gives you the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in the course by 
investigating a Windows 10 PC, securing it, and then explaining what you 
found and did in your security report. The same skills you use on one PC can 
be applied to thousands.

### Certification
